        "venture outside, returning only to feed."
        "In the case of multiple infants belonging to the same mother, each "
        "infant feeds only from its own individual teat, and each teat "
        "provides a different mix of nutrients depending on the age of that "

        " bat, and the designation of which one is actually the smallest can "
        "sometimes be contentious. "
        "Another animal which is sometimes awarded the title of the world's "
        "smallest mammal is Savi's pygmy shrew, a tiny insectivore small "
        "enough to run through the tunnels of large earthworms. "
